 ** NOTE **

 - BECAUSE THERE MAY BE JUNCTIONS WITH MULTIPLE TRIBUTARIES, THE NUMBER
   OF SUBCATCHMENTS MAY BE SMALLER THAN THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED NUMBER.

 - THE LAST LINE OF DATA DOES NOT REPRESENT A SUBCATCHMENT.
   IT REPRESENTS THE WATERSHED OUTLET CELL.

 - THE SUBCATCHMENT AREAS INTO THE OUTLET CELL ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE
   LAST CHANNEL LINK (PREVIOUS TO LAST DATA LINE).
   AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF THE SUBCATCHMENT AREAS OF THE LAST CHANNEL
   LINK INCLUDE, IN ADDITION TO THEIR OWN SUBCATCHMENT AREAS, THE SUBCATCHMENT
   AREAS INTO THE OUTLET CELL.

 - VALUE OF -1 INDICATES TERM NOT APPLICABLE.
